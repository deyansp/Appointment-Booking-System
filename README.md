This web app was created as part of a university assignment where I was required to design and develop an appointment booking system for a fictional university.

The emphasis was on the UX and UI of the app, which I designed myself starting from wireframes (see `Wireframes` folder) and later building out the design with Bootstrap. 

As part of the assessment the usability of the web app was measured through the System Usability Scale.

Users can create register, log in, book and manage their appointments for fictional univeristy services as well as read about each of the services offered. 

PHP was used on the backend with added protection from SQL and JavaScript injection attacks through prepared statements, input validation and sanitization.
